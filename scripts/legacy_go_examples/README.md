# Legacy Go Examples

This directory contains older, standalone Go script examples that were used for basic interactions with the Rysk Finance SDK.

These include:

- `balances.go`: An example to fetch balances.
- `connect.go`: A basic example to test WebSocket connectivity.

These are not part of the main `maker_quote_responder` application and are kept here for reference or simple, isolated testing purposes. They may require individual `go run` commands and specific environment variable setups to execute.
