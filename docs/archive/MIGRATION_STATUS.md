# Migration Status

## Overview
This document tracks the migration progress from the monolithic `cmd/maker_quote_responder` to the new modular structure under `internal/`.

## Completed Migrations ✅

### Market Maker Core
- **market_maker.go** → `internal/marketmaker/market_maker.go` (reduced from 1372 to ~237 lines)
- **orders.go** → `internal/marketmaker/orders.go`
- **quotes.go** → `internal/marketmaker/quotes.go`
- **positions.go** → `internal/marketmaker/positions.go`
- **reconciliation.go** → `internal/marketmaker/reconciliation.go`
- **stats.go** → `internal/marketmaker/stats.go`
- **types.go** → `internal/types/market_maker.go`

### Exchange Implementations
- **derive_*.go** files → `internal/exchange/derive/`
  - derive_ws_client.go (with concurrency fixes)
  - derive_auth.go
  - derive_order.go
  - derive_ticker.go
  - derive_trade_module.go
  - derive_markets.go
- **deribit_*.go** files → `internal/exchange/deribit/`

  - deribit_ed25519.go
  - deribit_asymmetric.go
- **exchange_*.go** files → `internal/exchange/`
  - factory.go
  - ccxt_wrapper.go

### Common Types
- Exchange interfaces → `internal/types/exchange.go`
- Market maker types → `internal/types/market_maker.go`
- RFQ types → `internal/types/rfq.go`
- RPC types → `internal/types/rpc.go`

### CLI
- New unified CLI → `cmd/atomizer/main.go`
  - market-maker subcommand implemented
  - rfq-responder subcommand (placeholder)

## Recently Completed Migrations ✅

### Arbitrage System
- ✅ `arbitrage_orchestrator.go` → `internal/arbitrage/orchestrator.go`
- ✅ Trade state management
- ✅ Trade queue processing
- ✅ Manual trade submission

### HTTP API
- ✅ `http_api.go` → `internal/api/server.go`
- ✅ All REST endpoints migrated
- ✅ CORS middleware
- ✅ Prometheus metrics endpoint

### RFQ Processing
- ✅ `rfq_processor.go` → `internal/rfq/processor.go`
- ✅ Quote debouncing mechanism
- ✅ EIP-712 signing
- ✅ Fallback pricing logic

### Risk Management
- ✅ `risk_manager.go` → `internal/risk/manager.go`
- ✅ Advanced stop-loss monitoring
- ✅ Greeks-based risk tracking
- ✅ Real-time risk metrics

### Hedging
- ✅ `hedge_manager.go` → `internal/hedging/manager.go`
- ✅ `gamma_hedger.go` → `internal/hedging/gamma/hedger.go`
- ✅ `gamma_module.go` → `internal/hedging/gamma/module.go`
- ✅ Retry logic for hedge execution
- ✅ Dynamic gamma hedging
- ✅ Delta-neutral strategies

## Recently Completed Tasks ✅

### Integration
- ✅ Wired up new packages in `cmd/atomizer/main.go`
- ✅ Implemented the `rfq-responder` subcommand
- ✅ Created WebSocket client for RFQ streaming
- ✅ Integrated all components (arbitrage, API, RFQ, risk, hedging)
- ✅ Code compiles successfully

## Remaining Tasks ❌

### Testing
- Test the integrated system with real connections
- Adapt existing test files to new structure

### Cleanup
- Delete old files from `cmd/maker_quote_responder`
- Update project documentation

### Production Readiness
- Replace mock WebSocket client with actual ryskcore integration
- Implement proper trade confirmation parsing
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Tests
**Test files to adapt:**
- `arbitrage_test.go`
- `market_maker_test.go`
- `market_maker_concurrent_test.go`
- `quoter_test.go`
- `derive_replace_order_test.go`
- `final_integration_test.go`

## Files Safe to Delete (After Migration)

These files have been fully migrated and can be deleted once we confirm everything works:
- Basic market maker files (market_maker.go, orders.go, quotes.go, etc.)
- Exchange connection files (derive_*.go, deribit_*.go)
- Common utilities that have been moved to internal/exchange/shared/

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Create new package structure
   ```
   internal/
   ├── arbitrage/
   ├── api/
   ├── rfq/
   └── hedging/
       └── gamma/
   ```

2. **Phase 2**: Migrate core functionality
   - Start with arbitrage orchestrator (highest priority)
   - Then HTTP API (needed for manual trades)
   - Then RFQ processor
   - Finally hedging modules

3. **Phase 3**: Update imports and test
   - Update cmd/atomizer to use new packages
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Manual testing of all features

4. **Phase 4**: Cleanup
   - Remove old files from cmd/maker_quote_responder
   - Update documentation
   - Remove temporary compatibility code

## Notes

- The arbitrage system is tightly integrated with other components, so it needs careful migration
- HTTP API is essential for manual trading and monitoring
- Gamma hedging is an advanced feature that should be preserved
- Test coverage is good and should be maintained during migration
