# Go-Idiomatic Structure Migration Progress

## Completed âœ…

1. **Created directory structure**:
   ```
   internal/
   â”œâ”€â”€ marketmaker/     # Core market maker logic
   â”œâ”€â”€ exchange/        # Exchange implementations
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ derive/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deribit/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ccxt/
   â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # Shared types and interfaces
   â”œâ”€â”€ hedging/        # Hedging strategies
   â”œâ”€â”€ cache/          # Cache implementations
   â””â”€â”€ risk/           # Risk management
   
   cmd/
   â””â”€â”€ atomizer/       # New unified CLI entry point
   ```

2. **Moved files to appropriate locations**:
   - Market maker core â†’ `internal/marketmaker/`
   - Exchange implementations â†’ `internal/exchange/`
   - Type definitions â†’ `internal/types/`
   - Hedging modules â†’ `internal/hedging/`
   - Cache modules â†’ `internal/cache/`

3. **Updated package declarations**:
   - Changed from `package main` to appropriate package names
   - Each directory now has its own package

4. **Created new CLI entry point**:
   - `cmd/atomizer/main.go` with subcommand structure

## Still Needed ðŸš§

1. **Fix import statements**:
   - Update all internal imports to use new package paths
   - Handle cross-package dependencies
   - Export necessary types and functions (capitalize first letter)

2. **Resolve circular dependencies**:
   - Some types may need to be moved to avoid import cycles
   - Consider creating interface packages

3. **Update go.mod**:
   - Ensure all external dependencies are present
   - May need to run `go mod tidy`

4. **Integration work**:
   - Wire up the new main.go to actually create and run components
   - Ensure configuration flows properly between packages

5. **Testing**:
   - Update test files to match new package structure
   - Ensure all tests still pass

## Benefits Already Visible

- Clean separation of concerns
- Can now properly use internal packages
- Better code organization for team collaboration
- Easier to test individual components
- More Go-idiomatic structure

## Next Steps

1. Create a script to update all imports automatically
2. Identify and fix any circular dependency issues
3. Make necessary types and functions public (exported)
4. Complete the integration in main.go
5. Run full test suite to ensure nothing broke
